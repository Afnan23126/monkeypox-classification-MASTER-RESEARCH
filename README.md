 ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This research proposes a hybrid classification system for six skin conditions â€” including Monkeypox â€” using features extracted from three pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2), enhanced by CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module), and classified using both an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and multiple SVM kernels.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run the Code

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook file: MonkeyPoxClassification_MArch2025_Final_with_ANN_18_Mar.ipynb
3. 3. Run the notebook step-by-step using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Make sure you upload the required dataset folders and `.npy` feature files if not already present.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: If you're using Google Colab, make sure to upload the necessary `.npy` feature files (e.g., extracted features, balanced data) to the environment before running the cells.
