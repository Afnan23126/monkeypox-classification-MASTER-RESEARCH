 ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This research proposes a hybrid classification system for six skin conditions â€” including Monkeypox â€” using features extracted from three pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2), enhanced by CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module), and classified using both an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and multiple SVM kernels.
